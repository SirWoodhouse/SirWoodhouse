## Hi there! 👋

My name is Arthur! Well not really, but I like my privacy and I'm a big fan of Archer so this moniker was an obvious choice.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, Flask. I have no background in IT or programming whatsoever, but I've always been interested in technology in general and decided I wanted to learn how to code.
- 🐋 Also learning about networks, Docker and deploying containers.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a private message!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love cats and doing sudokus.

- Cheers!
